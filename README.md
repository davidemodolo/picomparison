# Compare the same pictore took with N different devices.

# USAGE

Inside the JS first few rows change the **number of pictures** per device, give **each device a name** and set the **pictures' extension**.

Devices' names must be the same as the names of the folders that contain the images taken with their relative device.

Images must be saved in each folder as "1.jpg", "2.jpg"...

TODO:

- [ ] export button of the results in json format
- [ ] comment code
- [ ] better readme with examples
