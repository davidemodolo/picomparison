# Compare the same pictore took with N different devices.

Inside the JS first few rows change the **number of pictures** per device and give a **device a name**.

The devices' names must be the same as the names of the folders that contain the images taken with the relative device.

Images must be saved in each folder as "1.jpg", "2.jpg"...
